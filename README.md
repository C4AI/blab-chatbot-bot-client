# BLAB Chatbot - Bot Client

This repository contains a Python library that implements the bidirectional communication between a bot and
[BLAB Controller](../../../blab-controller). It should be used by Python programs that integrate
external bots with the controller.

The files [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and [RUN.md](RUN.md)
contain instructions on how to install and execute programs that use this library.
Note that each program may have additional requirements.

Examples with trivial implementations can
be found at [BLAB Chatbot Example](../../../blab-chatbot-example-python).

Documentation for the code and its API is hosted
[on GitHub Pages](https://c4ai.github.io/blab-chatbot-bot-client/)
alongside instructions on how to generate it locally.
